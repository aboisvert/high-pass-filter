@DRMacIver
Dear lazyweb. I have this series: https://gist.github.com/747274 I'd like to detect sudden drops and ignore gradual drops. Suggestions?

Solution
========

High-pass filter
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter

Sample
======

% ./high-pass-filter.sh series.txt 0.8

(Need Scala 2.8.x and gnuplot 4.x on your PATH)

Look at graph: all data points on the "high-pass filter" curve below zero
represent sudden drops -- where sudden drop is set by alpha value 0.8 above.
Tweak to your liking.
