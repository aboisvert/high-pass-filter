@DRMacIver
Dear lazyweb. I have this series: https://gist.github.com/747274 I'd like to detect sudden drops and ignore gradual drops. Suggestions?

Solution
========

High-pass filter
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter

Usage
=====

% ./high-pass-filter.sh [series] [alpha] [beta]

where,

 [series] - time series
 [alpha]  - frequency cutoff.
 [beta]   - amplitude cutoff.

Larger alpha means higher frequency cutoff (more noise); larger beta means
higher amplitude cutoff (less noise).

Sample
======

% ./high-pass-filter.sh series.txt 0.8 0.05

(Need Scala 2.8.x and gnuplot 4.x on your PATH)
